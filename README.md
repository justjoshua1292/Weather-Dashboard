# Weather-Dashboard
Assignment #6

For this assignment, we were called to use Third-party APIs which will allow us to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers usually retrieve data from another application's API often and using it in the context of their own pages. I used this to build my weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
Uses the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities & uses localStorage to store any persistent data. 
I also use multiple colors and cities for my dashboard to highlight different weather patterns across the country. Tried to keep my dashboard as simple as possible! I also use icons for my 5 day forecast & current day forecast! Take a look, you'll be able to click some cities on the page as well pre-listed and get their weather updates as well!
